## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

In a world filled with loud, distracting, anxiety inducing voices, what we need is something to slow us down and get our minds into a stream of focused mindfulness. Open `Calmer`, select your favorite tones, and feel the peace. You can save your preferred calming environment, and also see who is calming down.

### Design

![Calmer design](calmer-design.png)

Three different views provide login, playing, and about information. The play view allows the user to pick their calming tones, see what other users are playing, and also get the current weather forecast.
